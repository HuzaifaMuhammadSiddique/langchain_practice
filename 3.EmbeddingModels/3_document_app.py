GOAL OF THE APP
The app wiill take some documents as a strings in 1D list and it will also take a query as a string.

The app will tell us that the answer of this question is mostly likely to be present in which of the documents.

The app will return the document in which the answer may be present and it will also give us the cosine similarity score for it.

This is how the app will work:
1. Create an embedding of the query
2. Create an embedding of the documents
3. Find the cosine similarities between the query and each of the documents. And store them in a list.
4. Print out the document with the highest cosine similarity score

IMPORTANT
Because this is a very basic application, so we are not storing the embeddings that we are creating and thus our model has to create the embeddings every time we run the program which is both costly and time-consuming. It is better to store these embeddings in a vector database which we will talk about later
